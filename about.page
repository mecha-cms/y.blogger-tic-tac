This is not a clone of the original Tic Tac template. I didnâ€™t make it from the original source code, but by refactoring
it using more modern CSS and HTML syntax.

### Features

Other color variants of this template have been combined into one. You can enable other color variants via
`.\lot\y\blogger-tic-tac\state.php` file:

~~~ .php
<?php

return [
    'skin' => ['name' => 'green']
];
~~~

The default color variant is `green`. Another color variant is `blue`.
